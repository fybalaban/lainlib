## lainlib (C#) by fybalaban

**Name** | **Version**
-------- | ----------
Current assembly version: | 4.7.1
Current assembly file version: | 2.6.1
Target Framework: | .NET 5.0

## Notes
I developed this class library mainly for solving problems that I encountered while working on several different coding projects. I researched and tested for the most efficient algorithm. `lainlib` acts as a continuation of [LuddeToolset](https://github.com/fybx/LuddeToolset.git)
Ported from lainlib (.NET Framework 4.6) to .NET 5.0. Renamed the project to lainlib. Removed ErrorHandler class and all methods that depended on ErrorHandler.
